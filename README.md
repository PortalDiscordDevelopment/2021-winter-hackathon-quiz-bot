## To-Do

- `[Assignee: Uncreeperble]`Start Quiz Function, When a user types `/quiz <length>` is should respond with a message, with 2 buttons, a start button, and a join button.
The start button only starts the game if the original command runner clicks it, and the join button adds the clicker to a list of players who are playing.

- `[Assignee: ]`Quiz Function - After starting a game, an embed should popup with one of the <length> questions , in random order, where it would have 4 buttons attached, 
with the 4 possible answers. After all players have chose an option, or the time limit has ran out, it will move to the next question untill...

- `[Assignee: ]`Game Over - After all quetions have been asked a final embed will be shown, this will include all of the players scores AS WELL AS the originaal questions
in the order shown and their respecttive answers.

- `[Assignee: ]`Questions - A database of at LEAST (preferablly more, alot more) 50 questions & Answers will need to be created to ensure that each quiz is unique.

- `[Assignee: ]`Leaderboard - Everytime a player wins a triva (with at least 2 players/not solo mode) 1 'win' is  added to their GLOBAL leaderboard, with there being stats
such as loses and games plays as well

- `[Assignee: ]`Solo Mode - The solomode is for players who dont have friends, as this bot is inclusive, and is a mode where players can answer questions themselves.
This mode only counts a win if the player answers ALLL questions correct, otherwise its a loss, and will only have a PER-GUILD leaderboard
